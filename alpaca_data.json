Verus introduces Verus PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service), a true publicly notarized blockchain as a service with an easy to use built in wallet UI, designed to make it so that now anyone can start their very own full-fledged cryptocurrency so long as it can be funded or supported by miners. Newly created chains are just as secure as Verus itself and have the ability to be merge mined (up to 22x at once!) Benefiting both the user and the miners, self-strengthening the ecosystem and ensuring minimal fees (no room for middlemen to take a cut). Reserve backed currencies are also possible with fractional reserve capabilities and since interoperability is paramount, exchanging currencies in cross-chain transactions is as simple as sending coins from one wallet to a different coin\u2019s wallet. Conversions are handled by a built in market maker that automatically determines price based on a predetermined curve and issues orders fairly to all buy/sells within a block, with zero spread and the added benefit of eliminating the well- established problem of front-running, just some amount of slippage based on the net buy/sell.. With reserve currencies, buyers can make buys without even needing sellers (and vice versa). Amazingly, everything is done at the protocol level on a decentralized network, meaning Verus and it's associated chains can't be censored or stopped."}, {"prompt": "What is verusPay?", "input": "", "completion": "VerusPay is Blockchain-integrated payment gateway for accepting Verus Coin (VRSC) in a WooCommerce ecommerce store.

When an order is submitted via the VerusPay gateway, the order will be placed 'on-hold' while awaiting payment from the customer. The customer has a limited time wherein to send the payment and the store monitors the wallet/address to confirm payment received before releasing the order and redirecting the customer to the Thank You page. VerusPay uses limited API functionality for Manual Mode, to communicate with the blockchain explorer in verifying payments and with the veruspay.io API to get up-to-date price data. These API's do not receive any private data either about the store owner, store, or customer. The only data sent to the block explorer API is the public/transparent blockchain transaction and address used.

All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. **Revocable** -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self, and which has the permission to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft. **Recoverable** -- each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self, and which can recover the identity through redefining its primary state and the recovery state as well, though it cannot modify the revocation state, or vice versa, unless they are both controlled by the same underlying authority. **Private** - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong passport, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available."}, {"prompt": "What is verus referral program?", "input": "", "completion": "A Built-in Decentralized Referral Program, Enabling Natural Growth.

No one besides people participating in the network as miners, stakers, or ID referrers take any proceeds from the cost of an identity.

The best thing about that is that regardless of how much the Verus blockchain rewards miners over and above the pre-determined coinbase reward, it will be as a result of the on-chain economy, paid for by people buying identities with no inflation of the money supply!

Bitcoin, which was first to enable worldwide, P2P decentralized blockchain transactions, and most of its derivatives, offer ways to sign messages with specific private keys that can be verified against public addresses. While that does offer some limited signing capability, it does not offer capabilities that can compete with centralized services offering more sophisticated key management. A single public/private key pair lacks critical capabilities to make it suitable as an actual identity, most notable and obvious being the ability to recover from loss or theft of private keys, but arguably as important are friendly name aliases, modifiable multi-sig signing, updates, privacy, and the association of signed attestations by other identities to statements about properties of the identity. Verus ID enables free verifiable digital signatures for all through the Verus ID protocol as just one of the many new capabilities it enables. It is also the foundation upon which many new applications and additional capabilities can be built. For example, using Verus ID signatures, it\u2019s possible for any journalist anywhere to sign photos, videos, and content, establish a reputation for authenticity, and counter the potential for deep-fakes to make the truth harder to find. Open source projects can now create their own identities and digitally sign their binary releases, ensuring that not only can a file be verified by hash as the one downloaded from a particular server, but by signature as the actual file initially signed by the developer or release engineer. Signatures also form the basis for any attestation of one party to the validity of another.
